# Chuck's Programming Toolbox

A personal collection of programming knowledge and techniques, primarily focused on LeetCode-style problem-solving. This toolbox serves as a reference and learning resource for algorithms, data structures, and common patterns I've encountered and studied.

## Overview

This toolbox contains implementations, explanations, and insights for various programming concepts organized in a card-based structure. Each card represents a specific algorithm, pattern, or technique with my personal notes and explanations.

## Contents

The toolbox is organized into the following classifications:

### 🔍 **Searches**
Search algorithms and techniques for finding elements in data structures:
- Binary Search
- Linear Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- And more...

### 🔄 **Sorts**
Sorting algorithms with time/space complexity analysis:
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bubble Sort
- And more...

### 🧮 **Algorithms**
Core algorithmic techniques and problem-solving strategies:
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- String Algorithms
- And more...

### 💡 **Heuristics**
Problem-solving heuristics and mental models:
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- And more...

### 🎯 **Common Patterns**
Reusable patterns and templates for solving similar problems:
- Pattern matching techniques
- Common data structure operations
- Problem-solving templates
- And more...

## Structure

Each concept is presented as a **card** containing:
- **Implementation**: Code examples in TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Explanation**: My personal notes and understanding
- **Time/Space Complexity**: Analysis when applicable
- **Use Cases**: When to apply the technique
- **Related Problems**: Links to similar LeetCode problems

## Organization

Cards are organized by:
- **Classification**: The category (sorts, searches, algos, etc.)
- **Difficulty**: Complexity level when applicable
- **Tags**: For cross-referencing related concepts

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Philosophy

This is a living document that grows as I learn. Each addition represents a concept I've studied, implemented, and understood. The explanations are written in my own words to reinforce learning and serve as a personal reference.

## Contributing

This is a personal learning project, but suggestions and improvements are welcome!
